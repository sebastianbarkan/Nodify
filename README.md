# Nodify
Nodify enables Citizen Journalism using web3 technologies.

Using Gitcoin Passport to help citizen journalism flourish on-chain and establishing a link between news media, crowdfunding to finance journalism, and earnings for contribution to the verified journalism ecosystem.

# Inspiration
The inspiration for Nodify emerged from the growing need to address falsified media content.

# The Problem
False content, particularly on social media, is a growing problem:
1.	Falsified Photo Location: unable to verify the location of a photograph.
2.	Fake Photo Time: unable to verify the time a photograph was taken.
3.	Credibility of Photo Poster: unable to verify the credibility of the person who posted the photo.

With Nodify, anyone anywhere can verify where a photo was taken, the time that it was taken, and the credibility of the person who posted the photo.

# Our Solution
A dApp that allows users to:
1. Post 
2.	Verify the geo location of content based on metadata.
3. Verify the time a photograph was taken with a blockchain hash.
4. Verify the credibility of the person who posted the photo using Gitcoin Passport.

# How we built it

**Tech Stack:** 
- Gitcoin Passport
- EY
- Scroll
- zkSync
 
# Smart Contract Functionalities:
- On-chain verification of user's Gitcoin Passport Score

# What we learned
We learned that hacking a fully functioning Citizen Journalism app in 24 hours is very challenging.

# What's next for Nodify
With the right funding we aim to enable Citizen Journalism by:
1.	Releasing and launching MVP on Testnet
2.	Expanding platform features and capabilities
3.	Implementing a Crowd-Sourced Grants Pool to encourage and incentivize Citizen Journalism 

Release and Launch MVP on Testnet: Our primary focus during this phase will be to ensure that the initial features and functions of the platform are running smoothly. This includes the implementation of quadratic funding protocols, financing mechanisms, and operational support for Citizen Journalism. By launching our MVP on Testnet, we can gather vital feedback and address any potential issues before deploying the platform on the mainnet. This iterative process will help us to create a reliable, robust, and user-friendly platform for our users.

Expanding Platform Features and Capabilities: Our second goal is to continue to develop and refine our platform based on the needs of our growing user base. This could include introducing additional financial incentives via quadratic funding. By continuously enhancing our platform, we will ensure that it remains an effective platform for Citizen Journalism and that it continues to provide the best possible value to our users. We will also explore partnerships with other organizations to expand our reach and improve our platform's effectiveness.

Implementing a Crowd-Sourced Grants Pool: By implementing a crowd-sourced grants pool, we can encourage and incentivize Citizen Journalism in the future. This will allow citizen journalists to be funded by the broader community (rather than a centralized entity) to produce content for a specific news event or topic.
