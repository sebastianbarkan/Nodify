# Nodify
Nodify enables Citizen Journalism using web3 technologies. 

Our main goal is using Gitcoin Passport verification beneifts to help citizen journalism flourish on-chain and establishing a link between news media, crowdfunding to finance journalism, and earnings for contribution to the verified journalism ecosystem.

# Inspiration
The inspiration for Nodify emerged from the growing need to address falsified media content on-line.

# The Problem
False content, particularly on social media, is a growing problem:
1.	False Photo Location: unable to verify the location of a photograph.
2.	False Time That Photo Was Taken: unable to verify the time a photograph was taken.
3.	Credibility of Photo Poster: unable to verify the credibility of the person who posted the photo.

With Nodify, anyone anywhere can verify where a photo was taken, the time that it was taken, and the Gitcoin passport stamp based score credibility of the person who posted the photo.

# Our Solution
A dApp that allows users to:
1. Post verified content.
2.	Verify the geo location of content based on metadata, with a hash on chain for the provenenace of the photo.
3. Verify the time a photograph was taken from in app camera viaa a blockchain hash.
4. Crowdsource content moderation and the verification of the photos using Gitcoin Passport.

# How we built it

**Tech Stack:** 
- React
- Express
- Solidity
- Gitcoin Passport
- EY
- Scroll
- zkSync
 
# Smart Contract Functionalities:
- On-chain verification of user's Gitcoin Passport Score
- Privacy of on-chain score with EY Starlight
- Deployed on zkSyncEra Testnet
- Time-Locked Wallet with zkSync

# What we learned
We learned that building a fully functioning proof of concept of a Verified Citizen Journalism dApp in 24 hours is very challenging and rewarding.  We took up the challenge of incorporating Gitcoin Passport Scores, geographic meta data, and time stamps, and to build the most informative level of veracity for the proof of auntenticity of a photo for our users. We appreciated the good layout of the sponsor docs and learnt that by asking the right questions and using the resources avialable and speaking with the the sponsor teams on site we were able to learn a lot to continure building. Our solution works to bring the benefits and transparency of Web3 to a normally Web2 use case of journalism using Gitcoin and zkSync. We will work on solving the geogrpahic location containerization further as we test and further build out using EY Starlight and also look at what we learnt from attempting to builf our own Zk Proofs. 

# What's next for Nodify
With the right funding we aim to enable Citizen Journalism by:
1.	Releasing and launching MVP on Testnet
2.	Expanding platform features and capabilities
3.	Implementing a Crowd-Sourced Grants Pool to encourage and incentivize Citizen Journalists. 

Release and Launch MVP on Testnet: Our primary focus during this phase will be to ensure that the initial features and functions of the platform are running smoothly. This includes the implementation of quadratic funding protocols, financing mechanisms, and operational support for Citizen Journalism. By launching our MVP on Testnet, we can gather vital feedback and address any potential issues before deploying the platform on the mainnet. This iterative process will help us to create a reliable, robust, and user-friendly platform for our users.

Expanding Platform Features and Capabilities: Our second goal is to continue to develop and refine our platform based on the needs of our growing user base. This could include introducing additional financial incentives via quadratic funding. By continuously enhancing our platform and working with the Gitcoin Passport developments and additional stamps, we will ensure that it remains an effective platform for Citizen Journalism and that it continues to provide the best possible value to our users. We will also explore partnerships with other organizations to expand our reach and improve our platform's effectiveness.

Implementing a Crowd-Sourced Grants Pool: By implementing a crowd-sourced grants pool, we can encourage and incentivize Citizen Journalism in the future. This will allow citizen journalists to be funded by the broader community (rather than a centralized entity) to produce content for a specific news event or topic.
