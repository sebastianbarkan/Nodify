# Requirement 1:
Team must attend the EY Workshop: How to implement privacy for public blockchains​

Provide your team name, and a list of team members that attended the EY Workshop.​
Team Name: Nodify
Team Members at EY Workshop: Ahmed and Travis

# Requirement 2:​

Solution must be designed to run on a public network.​

Provide documentation on how your solution deploys to a public network.​

Provide documentation on which public network(s) your solution uses.​
Sepolia Testnet

# ​Requirement 3:​

Solution must be designed to run under privacy (implementation optional).​

Write one paragraph on why your solution will benefit from implementing privacy.​

Our solution will benefit from implementing privacy to protect citizen journalists from exposing their personal information.
Citizen Journalists are encouraged to use our application to post their content to social media platforms. However, at times they may be
covering news in dangerous parts of the world, which puts them at risk to having their information exposed to bad actors. By making this personal 
information private, we can protect them from this negative situation


Write one paragraph on which privacy solution you selected (and why).​

We selected the EY Starlight privacy solution. This solution allows us to make certain data within our smart contract private so that bad actors are
unable to access it.

Create an Architecture diagram on how your solution will bridge between the public network and a privacy solution (ie: Starlight).   
Solidity contract --> Zolidity contract --> zappify --> zApp

What services & connections will you use?          ​
EY Starlight

What workflow(s) will be used under privacy?
The Nodify Solidity Contract will be transpiled into a Zolidity Contract.
